# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in JavaScript.

Each problem's solution is organized in its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find the following:

- **`problem-name.js`**: JavaScript code containing the solution to the problem.
